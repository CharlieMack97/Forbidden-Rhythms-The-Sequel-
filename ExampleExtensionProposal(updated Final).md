## Title of Extension

Forbidden Rhythm: But it's survival of the fittest in 1 level.

## Brief Overview of game 

I plan to take the project main level and use a scrolling background with enemies that will spawn either side and move towards the dino. The dino then has to time his actions with the beats to fight them off while recieveing points of coins that could be used for upgrades in the future.

The game will have scalling difficulty with the possibility of being 2 player so you could work with your friend to survive the onslaught of lecturer's and in time with the beats.

The main level should be similar to a side scrolling shooter 

I may extend the enemies to be of different types with different abilities or attacks maybe even aerial attacks.



## Must Have Features

* **New Level/Style to Game** The Game should now support on going survival aspects with animated enemies moving towards the player with a scrolling background. 
* **Local Multiplayer** Systems to support up to 2 players joining at a time with various input devices
* **Player Features** The player class must be expanded to have a form of gravity and ability to dodge attacks while keeping in beat/ if actions made outside of the beat punishment applied 


## Should Have Features

* **Unique character powers** Each of the 2 characters should have differnt lives and attacks.
* **Timed element** The attacks should only be allowed in time with the beat re-using the similar mechanic of the loading bar.

## Could Have Features

## Wish to Have Features

* **Advanced enemy variety** Expand the enemy types so that there are more than bouncers trying to knock you back to the start. Include dogs, fans, the media and rival bands.
